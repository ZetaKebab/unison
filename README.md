![Main window](Screenshots/screen1.png)

**unison** is a very simple [Music Player Daemon (MPD)](https://www.musicpd.org/) daemon client with the following goals:

* lightweight window that can be toggled with shortcuts
* music control through shortcuts
* [Snapcast](https://mjaggard.github.io/snapcast/) integration

## Features

### Window

By default, unison works as a daemon in the taskbar system tray. You can display the main window when needed at any time with a shortcut.

### Shortcuts

You can control your music at anytime with the shortcuts. They can of course be used if the window is not visible.

### Snapcast

The main goal of embedding Snapcast is the ability to listen locally to music when I'm not using my main audio system. The computer running unison can then play music easily.

## Caveats

### Missing features

* Custom shortcuts.
* MPD passwords: I don't really see the point, but if asked, I will integrate them.
* Any sort of playlist and queue management. I use other software to do it, but I might implement them at some point.

### Wanted features

* A complete shuffle system based on set criteria, aka a smart playlist.
* Radio integration.
