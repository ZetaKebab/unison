# unison

![Main window](Screenshots/screen1.png)

**unison** is a very simple [Music Player Daemon (MPD)](https://www.musicpd.org/) daemon client with the following goals:

* lightweight window that can be toggled with shortcuts
* music control through shortcuts
* [Snapcast](https://mjaggard.github.io/snapcast/) integration
* Radio stations

## Features

### Window

By default, unison works as a daemon in the taskbar system tray. You can display the main window when needed at any time with a shortcut.

### Shortcuts

You can control your music at anytime with the shortcuts. They can of course be used if the window is not visible.

### Snapcast

The main goal of embedding Snapcast is the ability to listen locally to music when I'm not using my main audio system. The computer running unison can then play music easily.

### Radio stations

Through [Radio-Browser](https://www.radio-browser.info), a community database, you can play radio-streams directly from unison. There are more than 28,000 stations recorded on this service, so it should be a nice way to discover new music and cultures.

## Caveats

### Missing features

* MPD passwords: I don't really see the point, but if asked, I will integrate them.

### Wanted features

* A complete shuffle system based on set criteria, aka a smart playlist.
* Any sort of playlist and queue management. I use other software to do it, but I will implement them at some point.
